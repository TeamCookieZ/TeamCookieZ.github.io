# Initial
Looking through the provided source code, there are 3 endpoints available in this API application. Namely, `/api`, `/api/login` and `/api/user/:userid`. 

```js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var { loginValidator, sendValidationErrors } = require('../middlewares/validators');
var { localAuthenticator } = require('../middlewares/authenticators');
var { User } = require('../models')
var encryptFlag = require('../helpers/encryptFlag');

router.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

router.post('/login', loginValidator, sendValidationErrors, localAuthenticator, function (req, res) {
  res.json({ "flagOne": process.env.FLAG_ONE, "encryptedFlagTwo": encryptFlag(process.env.FLAG_TWO) })
});

router.get('/user/:userId', async function (req, res) {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.userId, { "attributes": ["username"] });
  res.json(user)
});


module.exports = router;
```

Validation of inputs were done with `express-validator` module and authentication was done with `passportjs`. 

The validation code attempts to check for `username` and `password` in the request and if the check fails, a `400` error will be shown.

The authentication code attempts to use passportjs's local-strategy to authenticate user. 

# Unexpected findings

Looking at the code, I was initially not able to find any vulnerabilities or insecure coding. However, I assumed the login would trigger this part of the code: 

```js
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
    async function (username, password, done) {
        const user = await User.findOne({ where: { username } });
        if (user !== null && bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
            if (user.username === 'gru_felonius' && bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
                return done(null, user);
            }
            return done(new Error('Only Gru is allowed!'));
        }
        return done(new Error('Invalid credentials'));
    }
));
````

As such, I used `gru_felonius` as the username and kept on trying different types of passwords. As I was feeling rather tired, I accidentally clicked on my mouse button which was coincidentally on the `Send` button with just the username entered in and password left empty and the flag was shown :O


After I solved it, I looked into how the check was bypassed with empty password and was surprised that `User.findOne({ where: { username } });` will always return a Query object even if the value of `where` is `undefined`. As such, the check for `user !== null` will be bypassed as `user` will never be null. I was unable to understand how the other checks were bypassed. 

# Intended solution

The intended solution for the challenge was to have an empty request body while having `username` and `password` in the header of the request. 

```js {% raw %}
var { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

const loginValidator = [
  check('username').exists(),
  check('password').exists()
]

function sendValidationErrors(req, res, next) {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: `Invalid parameters: ${errors.array().map(error => error.param).join(', ')}` });
  }
  next()
}

module.exports = {
  loginValidator,
  sendValidationErrors,
} {% endraw %} 
```

The `check` function checks the entire request for the field specified. As such, including it in the header will allow the `check` function to pass while other functions will only check in `req.body`. This will cause other functions to return `null`.

```
Creates a validation chain for one field. It may be located in any of the following request objects:

req.params
req.query
req.body
req.headers
req.cookies
```

The correct function to use in this legacy API is the `checkBody` function. The 
`checkBody` function, as the name implies, only checks `req.body`.

# Post CTF

After the competition has ended, I had a discussion with [@farisv](https://github.com/farisv) from [PDKT](https://github.com/PDKT-Team) whose team achieved 4th on the open category leaderboard.

The reason why the check was bypassed with `null` username and password was because of an intended feature in passport which calls a callback function on error if a custom callback function was defined.  

```js
if (callback) {
  if (!multi) {
    return callback(null, false, failures[0].challenge, failures[0].status);
  } else {
    var challenges = failures.map(function(f) { return f.challenge; });
    var statuses = failures.map(function(f) { return f.status; });
    return callback(null, false, challenges, statuses);
  }
}
```

As mentioned by passportjs documentation `If authentication failed, user will be set to false.` As such, the correct function should include a check for if `user` is `null`.

```js
function localAuthenticator(req, res, next) {
  passport.authenticate('local', { session: false }, function (err, user, info) {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(401).json({
            "error": err.message
        });
      }
      if (!user) { 
        return res.status(401).json({
          "error": err.message
        }); 
      }
      next();
  })(req, res, next)
}
```


Using either methods will cause the server to response with this result:

```
{
    "flagOne": "govtech-csg{m!sS1nG_cR3DeN+!@1s}",
    "encryptedFlagTwo": "717f4cda287d40c47e7b50cb772b4def5a415387257510d1"
}
```

# Thoughts

Although I got the flag for the challenge, I still did not fully understand the source code. Maybe only part of the source code was given to the competitors. Anyways, I will add an additional section if I managed to figure it out.
